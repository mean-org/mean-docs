# ðŸ«‚ MeanDAO

The Mean Finance Ecosystem formed MeanDAO on Dec 24th, 2021, with the objective of supporting the public goods protocols developed by the core team, namely the Token Streamer (aka Payment Streaming protocol) and the Solar Shield (aka Mean Multisig).

The core team relegated control of those protocols' parameters and revenue drivers to the DAO Governance and re-stated their alignment with the overall Mean Finance Mission.&#x20;

As a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization with membership across the world and with products exclusively in the Solana Ecosystem, the DAO further focused its mission on a single metric:

{% hint style="success" %}
Onboard and grow **business operational payments token volume** in Solana DeFi
{% endhint %}

Let's break that apart back to front.

1. **DeFi** = focused on DeFi, full-stop
   * &#x20;This also means not focusing on collectibles, games, etc.
2. **Solana** = focused on Solana DeFi, full-stop
   * This also means not focusing on Ethereum, Polygon, Bitcoin, etc.
3. **Token Volume** = focused on Solana DeFi Token Volume, full-stop
   * This also means not focusing on TVL, On/Off Ramp and Bridge Volume, # of Users, etc
4. **Business Operational Payments** = focused on business use cases with lots of volumes, like Payroll, Token Vesting for VCs, Business Loans, etc.
   * This also means not focusing on non-operational volume, like trading volume, P2P volume, remittance volume, etc.
5. **Onboard and Grow** = focused on bringing new businesses and growing existing ones.
   * This also means not focusing on retail and individual users.

# ðŸ«‚ MeanDAO

The Mean Finance Ecosystem formed MeanDAO on Dec 24th, 2021, with the objective of supporting the public goods protocols developed by the core team, namely the Token Streamer (aka Payment Streaming protocol) and the Solar Shield (aka Mean Multisig).

The core team relegated control of those protocols' parameters and revenue drivers to the DAO Governance and re-stated their alignment with the overall Mean Finance Mission.&#x20;

As a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization with membership across the world and with products exclusively in the Solana Ecosystem, the DAO further focused its mission on a single metric:

**Onboard and grow business operational token volume in Solana DeFi**

# ðŸª™ MEAN Token

## What is the $MEAN token?

MEAN is the governance token of the MeanDAO. It allows those who hold it to vote on changes in the Community Treasury and the MeanDAO protocols.&#x20;

The token is deployed on the Solana Blockchain as an SPL Token. The ongoing audits for the SPL Token smart contract and related on-chain programs can be found [HERE](https://github.com/solana-labs/security-audits).&#x20;

Additional details about the deployed token parameters are below:&#x20;

* **Symbol**: $MEAN
* **Type**: Solana SPL Token
* **Total Supply**: 210,000,000&#x20;
* **TGE**: Dec 24th 2021
* **Purpose**: Governance

## Allocations & Distributions

![](broken-reference)

### **Community & Rewards (70%)**&#x20;

The lion's share of MEAN tokens will go to the community. We want MeanDAO to be owned and run by the community invested in the mission of the overall ecosystem. Below is the breakdown of how MEAN tokens will be distributed to the community.

#### â†’ Community Treasury (40%)

These are MEAN tokens owned by the community. The community can vote on how to use these tokens.

The Community Treasury will have a stepped linear vesting schedule at every Solana block over three years, starting on the Token Generation Event in line with the schedule below:

* **Year 1**: 50% of the treasury tokens vested
* **Year 2**: 30% of the treasury tokens vested
* **Year 3**: 20% of the treasury tokens vested

#### â†’ Initial Rewards & **Incentivized Programs (30%)**

This program will run for two years from TGE and will cover

1. Retroactive rewards&#x20;
2. Staking incentive rewards&#x20;
3. Liquidity mining programs

Liquidity mining incentives are deployed directly through the AMMs, where liquidity is provided. These are likely to be moving targets as different collaborations are finalized with the different Solana AMMs. At TGE, our launch AMM partners are Orca and Raydium, with long-term commitments to pools and farming rewards.  &#x20;

### **Team & Advisors (20%)**&#x20;

Team allocations are set aside for founding team members. They provide direction to the network in its early stages and maintain and upgrade the codebase following governance votes.&#x20;

Team and advisor allocations have a waiting period of 6 months after TGE, are vested over 48 months linearly, and can be stopped by governance votes if the team does not perform accordingly.

### **Token Sale (10%)** &#x20;

Use of Funds:

1. **Bootstrapping Liquidity (50%) â†’** Depending on the market, up to 50% is reserved for bootstrapping on-chain liquidity across various pools with no less than $250k/pool.
2. **Contract Auditing (10%) â†’** Ongoing auditing for the Token Streaming and Multisig protocols is budgeted at 10% of the token sale proceeds.
3. **Growth/Marketing (10%) â†’** Thereâ€™s a heavy education and content component on the approach we need to take to grab the marketâ€™s attention.
4. **Development (20%) â†’** We have an extensive roadmap and need additional help with product development resources. We must fund the devs to let them focus on building without stress for 12-18 months.&#x20;
5. **Partnerships (10%) â†’** Getting listed in CEXes and penning strategic partnerships.

## Liquidity & Utility

### Token Holders

Here's an overview of the benefits for MEAN token holders that go well beyond Voting Power on the DAO's improvement proposals.

![](broken-reference)

### Mean Power

Mean Power represents the amount of MEAN a user holds in their account address and throughout different protocols in Solana. The greater your Mean Power, the greater your say is in protocol governance decisions.

### Staking

Mean staking rewards include emission incentives plus a share of the protocol revenues, and can be boosted using locking periods.&#x20;

#### How to stake MEAN?

When you stake MEAN you receive sMEAN in return. sMEAN represents a claim on MEAN staked in the staking vault. sMEAN is an SPL token and is movable, and tradable, making MEAN staking a fully liquid staking solution.&#x20;

The amount of sMEAN you receive when stake MEAN is calculated based on the price difference between sMEAN and MEAN. The price of sMEAN is determined by the total MEAN in the pool over and above the amount that has been staked. This price will grow as more emissions and fee revenue are deposited into the staking vault.

#### Claiming staking rewards

MEAN Staking is a liquid form of staking, lide Lido, or Marinade. When you stake mean and receive unlocked sMEAN, you do not need to 'claim' your rewards as they will be distributed to you when you unstake. On top of getting back the MEAN you staked, you will also receive a share of the fees and emissions added to the staking vault (as extra MEAN). The longer you leave your MEAN staked, the more MEAN you will make.

#### Locking my MEAN Stake

In an upcoming release of the MEAN staking program, the DAO plans to offer locking periods you can use to boost your rewards. Staking MEAN will then involve locking your tokens for a predetermined amount of time in the Mean Protocol.&#x20;

MEAN holders lock their MEAN for two reasons, to boost their Mean Power or to boost their share of the protocolâ€™s dividends. There are both short and long locking time-frames from 7 days to 4 years to choose from. The longer a user locks their MEAN tokens, the larger the boost they receive in rewards and Mean Power. While your tokens are locked, they cannot be unlocked or transferred by users. Please be mindful of this and plan accordingly to navigate market conditions.&#x20;

### Distributions

If you stake and lock your MEAN for 30 days or more, you become eligible to Mean Protocol dividends that are paid in MEAN and distributed automatically every Wednesday.

The protocol distributes 40% of the revenues allocated to the repurchase program directly to MEAN stakers in the form of dividends. The distribution is relative to how many MEAN tokens each user has staked as a percentage of the entire MEAN stake. The larger your percentage the larger your dividend allocation.&#x20;

A snapshot is taken every Sunday to calculate how the weekâ€™s distribution will be shared. Revenue is then distributed the following Wednesday via the rewards page.

To ensure the long-term health of the Mean DAO and the tokenomics of the MEAN governance token, we have in place from day one a MEAN Repurchase Program. The program provides further alignment and upwards price pressure of the MEAN token by creating a closed feeding cycle between revenues and MEAN token holders.&#x20;

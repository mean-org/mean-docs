# ðŸ”´ Gov Token (MEAN)

## What is the $MEAN token?

MEAN is the governance token of the MeanDAO. It allows those who hold it to vote on changes in the Community Treasury and the MeanDAO protocols.&#x20;

The token is deployed on the Solana Blockchain as an SPL Token. The ongoing audits for the SPL Token smart contract and related on-chain programs can be found [HERE](https://github.com/solana-labs/security-audits).&#x20;

Additional details about the deployed token parameters are below:&#x20;

* **Symbol**: $MEAN
* **Type**: Solana SPL Token
* **Total Supply**: 210,000,000&#x20;
* **TGE**: Dec 24th, 2021
* **Purpose**: Governance

## Allocations & Distributions

### **Community & Rewards (70%)**&#x20;

The lion's share of MEAN tokens will go to the community. We want MeanDAO to be owned and run by the community invested in the mission of the overall ecosystem. Below is the breakdown of how MEAN tokens will be distributed to the community.

#### â†’ Community Treasury (40%)

These are MEAN tokens owned by the community. The community can vote on how to use these tokens.

The Community Treasury will have a stepped linear vesting schedule at every Solana block over three years, starting on the Token Generation Event in line with the schedule below:

* **Year 1**: 50% of the treasury tokens vested
* **Year 2**: 30% of the treasury tokens vested
* **Year 3**: 20% of the treasury tokens vested

#### â†’ Initial Rewards & **Incentivized Programs (30%)**

This program will run for two years from TGE and will cover

1. Retroactive rewards&#x20;
2. Staking incentive rewards&#x20;
3. Liquidity mining programs

Liquidity mining incentives are deployed directly through the AMMs, where liquidity is provided. These are likely to be moving targets as different collaborations are finalized with the different Solana AMMs. At TGE, our launch AMM partners are Orca and Raydium, with long-term commitments to pools and farming rewards.  &#x20;

### **Team & Advisors (20%)**&#x20;

Team allocations are set aside for founding team members. They provide direction to the network in its early stages and maintain and upgrade the codebase following governance votes.&#x20;

Team and advisor allocations have a waiting period of 6 months after TGE, are vested over 48 months linearly, and can be stopped by governance votes if the team does not perform accordingly.

### **Token Sale (10%)** &#x20;

Use of Funds:

1. **Bootstrapping Liquidity (50%) â†’** Depending on the market, up to 50% is reserved for bootstrapping on-chain liquidity across various pools with no less than $250k/pool.
2. **Contract Auditing (10%) â†’** Ongoing auditing for the Token Streaming and Multisig protocols is budgeted at 10% of the token sale proceeds.
3. **Growth/Marketing (10%) â†’** Thereâ€™s a heavy education and content component on the approach we need to take to grab the marketâ€™s attention.
4. **Development (20%) â†’** We have an extensive roadmap and need additional help with product development resources. We must fund the devs to let them focus on building without stress for 12-18 months.&#x20;
5. **Partnerships (10%) â†’** Getting listed in CEXes and penning strategic partnerships.

Note that most of these protocols are permissionless, and neither MeanDAO nor its members have control over them. Please exercise caution when interacting with other smart contracts.
